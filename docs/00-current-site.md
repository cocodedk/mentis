Links

The navigation uses uppercase sans‑serif text. The active page is indicated with a filled black rectangle behind the link (as on the Forside tab in the screenshot
mentis.dk
).

Visual design

Colour scheme: The website uses a light blue background (#e5f1fb) with darker blue highlights. The header text and headings are navy (#004ea8). Sections such as the “INFORMATIONER” boxes and opening‑hours panel are filled with a slightly darker blue (#cde0f8). Buttons (e.g., “LOGIN HER”) are white with blue outlines and blue text. Links are blue, and hover states are underlined. Footers switch to a grey background (#5d5d5d).

Typography: A clean sans‑serif font (likely Helvetica/Arial) is used throughout. Headings are in uppercase and bold. Body text is left‑aligned with generous line spacing.

Imagery: The home page features a large hero image of a woman receiving TMS therapy with a doctor adjusting the device
mentis.dk
. Many pages include small icons (e.g., a stethoscope for the self‑service section) or staff photos.

Layout: Content is organized in cards and sections separated by ample whitespace. The home page uses a two‑column layout: a left sidebar lists information topics (“VELKOMMEN”, “HVOR SKAL DU MØDE OP” and “JULEFERIE”); selecting an item updates the right‑side panel with the corresponding text. The contact and opening hours appear in a dedicated section with a large clock icon and lists of times.

Footer: The footer displays the clinic’s name, address (Vejlbjergvej 8A, 8240 Risskov), telephone number (81 40 93 33) and an embedded map. The CVR number (38744429) and cookie notice are included.

Behandlinger (Treatments)

The Behandlinger menu expands to several therapy and evaluation options:

Sub‑page	Highlights
TMS (Transkraniel magnetisk stimulation)	Explains that TMS is an approved treatment for depression, OCD and some anxiety disorders. A non‑invasive magnetic coil stimulates nerve cells in the frontal lobe
mentis.dk
. The therapy is delivered twice daily for 15 days and includes pre‑ and post‑consultations
mentis.dk
. It emphasises that rTMS can be more effective than antidepressants; side effects are minimal (mild discomfort or headache) and patients can resume daily activities immediately
mentis.dk
. Patients typically require one 3‑week course with maintenance sessions every 4–6 months
mentis.dk
.
Korte forløb	Short diagnostic and treatment courses; after confirming a diagnosis (e.g., ADHD), the clinic offers a treatment start and a brief follow‑up before transferring care back to the patient’s GP
mentis.dk
.
Mindfulness	Describes mindfulness training to help patients stay present, reduce rumination and manage stress, anxiety and depression. The course combines meditation and yoga exercises and is recommended for those with stress and mood issues
mentis.dk
.
Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT)	Derived from cognitive behavioural therapy, CFT targets individuals with low self‑esteem and poor emotional regulation. It helps build self‑compassion and balance the brain’s threat, drive and soothing systems
mentis.dk
. Therapy fosters self‑reflection and replaces self‑criticism with well‑being and healthier relationships
mentis.dk
.
Undersøgelse/udredning	Outlines evaluation services: (1) specialist medical reports based on psychiatric examinations, (2) neuropsychiatric assessments to determine whether behavioural changes have an underlying brain‑organic cause (often requiring neuropsychological tests and scans), and (3) psychiatric evaluations for specific or general diagnoses
mentis.dk
.
Kurser	Mentis runs courses and supervision in psychiatric and neuropsychiatric topics. The clinic has its own teaching room for ~40 participants

Key observations for redesign

Consistency and readability: The site maintains consistent typography, colours and layout across pages, which helps clarity. However, some pages (particularly the staff page) contain long blocks of text. Breaking biographies into sections or using accordions could improve scannability.

Cookie banner: The cookie banner blocks access on first visit and may annoy users. Redesigning it as a banner at the bottom rather than a modal could improve usability.

Navigation: The current navigation is straightforward but uses all‑caps. Introducing drop‑down menus for sub‑pages (under “Behandlinger” and “Praktisk information”) could declutter the header.

Accessibility: The light blue text on white backgrounds may not provide sufficient contrast for visually impaired users. Enhancing contrast and ensuring keyboard navigation would improve accessibility.

Mobile responsiveness: Although the site uses simple layouts, verifying and potentially improving responsiveness on mobile devices will be important in a redesign.

Multilingual support: The site is in Danish only. If serving a multilingual audience, providing an English version could be beneficial.

The information above summarises the structure, content and design of Mentis Neuropsykiatrisk Klinik’s website and identifies key areas to consider when planning a redesign.
