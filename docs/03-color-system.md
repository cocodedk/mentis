You’re absolutely right — **color is critical here**, especially for a **neuropsychiatric / medical** context.
I’ll be very deliberate and opinionated, and I’ll tie everything back to *trust, calm, clarity, and accessibility*.

Below is a **recommended modern color system**, *why it works*, and *how to apply it*.

---

## 1. What’s wrong with the current color usage (diagnosis)

Current site characteristics:

* Heavy, flat blue blocks
* Too many similar blues → poor hierarchy
* Blue used for **everything** (backgrounds, headings, links)
* Low emotional warmth
* Feels “institutional” rather than “human”

**Core problem**

> The color scheme doesn’t guide the eye — it overwhelms it.

---

## 2. Design goals for Mentis’ color scheme

For a neuropsychiatric clinic, the palette must communicate:

* 🧠 **Clinical competence**
* 🫂 **Psychological safety**
* 🧘 **Calm & stability**
* 🧭 **Clarity and orientation**
* ♿ **Accessibility (contrast!)**

This is **not** a place for:

* Loud accents
* High saturation
* Trendy neon
* Strong contrasts except where functional

---

## 3. Recommended Core Color Strategy (Modern & Safe)

### 🔹 1. Primary Color — Calm Clinical Blue

Replace the current harsh blue with a **desaturated, softer blue**.

**Primary Blue**

```
#1F4E5F   (Deep desaturated teal-blue)
```

Why:

* Still medical
* Less aggressive
* More modern
* Works well with white space

Usage:

* Header background (optional)
* Section titles
* Icons
* Active navigation item

---

### 🔹 2. Secondary Color — Soft Blue-Grey (Backgrounds)

Instead of solid blue blocks:

```
#F2F6F8   (Very light blue-grey)
```

Why:

* Keeps clinical tone
* Reduces visual fatigue
* Allows text to breathe

Usage:

* Section backgrounds
* Info blocks
* Cards grouping content

---

### 🔹 3. Neutral Base — Off-white (Not pure white)

Avoid stark white.

```
#FAFAFA   (Main background)
#FFFFFF   (Cards only)
```

Why:

* Softer on the eyes
* More premium feel
* Better for long reading

---

### 🔹 4. Text Colors (Critical!)

**Primary text**

```
#1E2930   (Almost-black, slightly blue)
```

**Secondary text**

```
#5B6B73
```

Why:

* Better readability
* Less harsh than pure black
* Consistent with healthcare UX standards

---

### 🔹 5. Accent Color — Muted Green (Human & Healing)

Add *one* warm, human accent — **sparingly**.

```
#5FA8A1   (Muted green-teal)
```

Why:

* Associated with healing and balance
* Works well with blue
* Doesn’t feel “marketing-ish”

Usage:

* Icons
* Small highlights
* Callouts
* Secondary CTAs

⚠️ Never use this as a background for long text.

---

## 4. CTA Color Strategy (Very important)

### Primary CTA (Contact / Book)

```
Background: #1F4E5F
Text:       #FFFFFF
Hover:      #163E4D
```

### Secondary CTA

```
Border:     #1F4E5F
Text:       #1F4E5F
Background: Transparent
Hover:      #F2F6F8
```

This ensures:

* Clear action hierarchy
* No “button overload”
* Calm but confident calls to action

---

## 5. What NOT to do (important)

❌ No bright green “success” buttons
❌ No red alerts except real warnings
❌ No full-width dark blue sections stacked vertically
❌ No blue text blocks with white text longer than 3 lines
❌ No gradients unless extremely subtle

---

## 6. Example: Homepage Color Application

```
[ Header ]
Background: White
Logo/Nav:   Primary Blue

[ Hero ]
Background: Image + subtle dark overlay
Text: White

[ Services Section ]
Background: Off-white
Cards: White
Icons: Primary Blue

[ Practical Info ]
Background: Light Blue-Grey
Text: Dark neutral

[ Footer ]
Background: #1E2930
Text: #E5E7EB
Links: #A7C7CC
```

---

## 7. Accessibility & Compliance (Non-negotiable)

* Minimum WCAG AA contrast
* Body text contrast ≥ 4.5:1
* Buttons ≥ 3:1
* Links **must not rely on color alone**
* Focus states visible (outline or underline)

This is especially important for:

* ADHD
* Anxiety
* Cognitive fatigue
* Older patients

---

## 8. Alternative Palette (Slightly Warmer Option)

If Mentis wants *more warmth* and *less clinical*:

* Primary: `#2C5D63`
* Accent: `#C7A46B` (muted sand)
* Background: `#F7F6F4`

This feels more **private clinic / premium**, less hospital.

---

## 9. Recommendation (Direct & Honest)

For Mentis specifically, I recommend:

> **Soft blue + blue-grey + muted green**
> Not trendy. Not flashy. Timeless. Safe. Professional.

It will:

* Age well (5–10 years)
* Support trust
* Reduce cognitive load
* Work beautifully with modern typography
